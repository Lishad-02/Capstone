| Paper Title | What They Did | Uniqueness |
|-------------|---------------|------------|
| **Unraveling Urban Traffic Congestion Patterns in Bangladesh** (Hasan & Sarker, 2025) | Analyzed traffic congestion using **139,008 Google Maps snapshots** collected over six months. Applied **time series decomposition** and **hierarchical clustering with Dynamic Time Warping (DTW)** to identify spatiotemporal congestion clusters across all divisions in Bangladesh. | Introduced a **DTW-based clustering** approach to visualize and categorize complex traffic dynamics, offering a scalable model for national-level traffic pattern recognition. |
| **Understanding Dhaka City Traffic Intensity and Traffic Expansion Using Gravity Model** (Sayed, Rahman, Zaber, Ali, 2023) | Investigated congestion propagation in Dhaka using **real-time Google Maps data** and applied the **gravity model** to show how congestion expands from central to peripheral zones. Focused on traffic intensity at junctions and corridors. | Pioneered the **use of the gravity model** for visual traffic data, helping understand directional congestion expansion‚Äîuseful for city planning and predictive modeling. |
| **Inferring Traffic Patterns of Dhaka City: A Spatio-temporal Analysis Over a Year** (Rahman & Nower, 2024) | Collected **350,400 Google Maps snapshots** across 12 months. Divided Dhaka into 10 zones and conducted **spatiotemporal and statistical analysis**, identifying variations across weekdays/weekends and day/night. | Offers a **comprehensive year-long analysis** using big data tools, making it the most detailed visual congestion study of Dhaka to date. |
| **Modeling Traffic Congestion in Developing Countries Using Google Maps Data** (Pramanik et al., 2020) | Proposed a **low-cost framework** using Google Maps traffic layer snapshots. Applied **Historical Averages, SVR, SVR-Graph, and ARIMA** models to forecast traffic congestion and evaluate weekday/weekend variations. | Highlighted a **scalable alternative to sensor-based systems** for traffic prediction in low-resource settings, using only map visual data and classical ML models. |

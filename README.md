# Career Guidance

## Architecture-
                    
                                                                 
User Share his/her interested career / his interest through chat 
                        ↓ 
 Based on user’s chosen career suggest the no of skills needed  
(use multi classification model train on dataset) 
(And dataset build from international job portal) 
                         Or  
We can use Bert type model through prompt engineering 
                         ↓ 
Skill Declaration by User 
user will say which skill he/she already has 
                         ↓ 
Start evaluation of tech skills 
                         + 
Behavioral Assessment (through prompting)  
                        ↓ 
Different difficulty level Question Generation (through Prompt Engineering) 
Difficulty will change based on user ans  
                        ↓ 
              Take user Answer 
                         ↓ 
Evaluate answers (though prompt engineering technique)  
How much answer is related to actual answer, not just right or wrong evaluation 
                        ↓ 
Give scores for each ques and saved score in Database 
                        ↓ 
Give Feedback why answer is not correct or slightly correct  
              (Give explanation) 
                        ↓ 
Suggest Content needs to cover  
                        ↓ 
Again, user test his skill after completing the content 
                        ↓ 
Continue skill evaluation process 
                        + 
Project based evaluation (Through Prompting) 
                        ↓ 
Also give an estimated time based on user's progress  
(Short term forecasting model) / prompting 
                        ↓ 
There would be a threshold marks for each skill  
When the user passes the threshold marks for all the skills our agent will suggest “You are ready 
for this Job”

## Note
Total Data Need- 400 ( Software Engineer & Data Analyst)

**Software Engineer :** 150 global data for 3 country + 50 entry for Bangladesh 

**Data Analyst :** 150 global data for 3 country + 50 entry for Bangladesh 

*Collect differet job type data ( like : remote, in person ,hybrid)

*Must collect skills + qualifications both 

*Collect Required Experience Data also (like: 5 years experience needed / fresh graduate ): But better to collect   Fresh graduate or entry level jobs data
